# Baxter
The name is a jumbling together of the words __backtester__ and __saxo__, since the project was conceived of as a backtesting engine coupled to the [SaxoTrader](https://www.home.saxo/platforms/saxotrader) platform.

# Credits
The project is inspired by a series of articles on event-driven backtesting found [here](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-I/).
